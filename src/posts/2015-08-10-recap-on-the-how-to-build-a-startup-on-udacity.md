This is recap on the [How to Build a Startup](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-build-a-startup--ep245) course on Udacity.

The course introduces Business Model Canvas, which covers 9 essential components:

1. Value Proposition
2. Customer Segments
3. Channels
4. Customer Relationships
5. Revenue Models
6. Partners
7. Key Resources
8. Key Activities
9. Costs

#### Value Proposition
What are we building? for who? What does it solve for a targeted group of people? The key point is to get out of the building and validate with real people, whether it satisfy the customer's needs. As the result, what is the minimum viable product (MVP) once we acquire our understanding.

#### Customer Segments
Customer Segment is about who we are building for, what do they want to achieve, what pain do they want to solve and what gain do they want to see. The goal is to start a series of hypotheses, then validate our hypotheses with the real people and see whether we are right or wrong.

#### Channels
Is our product physical (e.g. can of food, Books) or virtual (e.g. insurance, stocks)? How does our product goes from our company to our customers? Is it through Physical Channel (Brick-and-mortar store) or Virtual Channel (E-commerce store, social network)
