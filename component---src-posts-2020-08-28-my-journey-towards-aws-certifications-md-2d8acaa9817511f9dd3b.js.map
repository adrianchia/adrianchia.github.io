As a self-proclaimed lifelong learner myself, I wanted to improve my knowledge and skills for my professional growth, and the COVID-19 pandemic situation provides a great opportunity for me to accomplish my goal.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`The Path(s)`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There are 12 AWS certifications in total with four different levels, see `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://aws.amazon.com/certification/\"\n      }}>{`https://aws.amazon.com/certification/`}</a>{` to learn more about each of them:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Foundational`}\n        <ul parentName=\"li\">\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Cloud Practitioner`}</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Associate`}\n        <ul parentName=\"li\">\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Solutions Architect`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`SysOps Administrator`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Developer`}</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Professional`}\n        <ul parentName=\"li\">\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Solutions Architect`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`DevOps Engineer`}</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Specialty`}\n        <ul parentName=\"li\">\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Advanced Networking`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Security`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Machine Learning`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Alexa Skill Builder`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Data Analytics`}</li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Database`}</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Depending on your career path or interest, you can select the best certifications that fit your needs. I started doing my first certification with AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner some time in mid-May 2020. I then spend the next 2 months completing all the associate levels certification and acquired the Solution Architect Professional just recently at this point of time.

After registered the exam, you need to download and install the OnVue application, which is used to monitor your exam by an actual proctor. You will get a link to perform a system check a few days prior to the actual exam to test if your computers have a functional microphone, speaker, and webcam. You will use either a driver’s license or a passport as your identification document, and use your mobile phone to take the surrounding area of your desk.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There will be no notes, papers, and books allowed, and you can’t leave your desk once the exam is started until it is over, and you are expected to be visible from your webcam at all time. You are also expected to show your wrists that there is no watch or smartwatch with you. Depending on the day and time of your actual exam, you might find it is hard to log into the PearsonVue system, so it is better to log into the system at least 30 minutes early.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`After the exam`}</h2>\n    <p>{`You will be notified whether you are pass or fail right after the exam. The actual certificate will be provided within 1 to 5 business days. I hope this article could help you pass the certification exam. Good luck!`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","parentName","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
